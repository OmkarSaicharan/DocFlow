# Collaborative Document Editor (DocFlow)

A premium, full-stack rich-text document manager built with **React**, **Vite**, **Express**, **Prisma**, and **SQLite**. It features instant `.txt`/`.md` imports, autosaving with visual feedback, and secure cross-user email sharing.

## 🎨 Visual Preview & User Features

1. **Rich-Text TipTap Editor**: A fast, fully interactive editing canvas with full formatting capabilities (bold, italic, underline, headings H1-H3, bullet lists, ordered lists) powered by [TipTap](https://tiptap.dev).
2. **Real-time Autosave**: Listens to edit states and triggers a debounced (1s) sync with the local SQLite server. High-fidelity visual badges change states instantly (`Saving changes...` -> `Saved` or `Autosave failed`).
3. **In-place Title Rename**: Double-click or type directly on the document's header input to rename files instantly (debounced at 800ms).
4. **Instant File Imports**: Drag-and-drop or select any `.txt` or `.md` files. The app automatically parses lines (converting markdown headers and bullet lists) and inserts them as interactive, styled documents in your SQLite database.
5. **Simulated User Switching**: A built-in "Persona Switcher" dropdown lets reviewers transition between multiple active email addresses (`omkarsaicharan@gmail.com`, `collaborator@example.com`, etc.) to test permission scopes and secure sharing in real-time.
6. **Robust Sharing System**: Share your documents with other users by email. Owned files can be deleted or shared, while shared files are read/write but protected from unauthorized owner-actions.

## 🧪 Running Automated Tests

A database integration test verifies the database schema, Prisma client, and local SQLite writes:
```bash
npm run test
```
Outputs:
```text

--> Built a lightweight collaborative document editor inspired by Google Docs, designed as a focused internal productivity tool for creating, editing, saving, importing, and sharing rich-text documents. The app supports core formatting features such as bold, italic, underline, headings, and lists through a modern rich-text editing experience, while keeping the scope intentionally practical for a take-home assignment.

--> It includes document ownership, simple sharing between seeded users, file import for .txt and .md files, and persistent storage so documents and access state remain available after refresh. The product is intentionally scoped around reliable end-to-end functionality rather than advanced features like real-time collaboration, which reflects the assignment’s emphasis on product judgment, engineering tradeoffs, and shipping a usable solution quickly.
